h2. Sarge

Cross browser JavaScript DOM library.

Sarge itself does not implement any functionality for DOM interaction, this is provided via plugins.

That's great becaue you can choose how hacky the implementation of the DOM interaction is. Writing a HTML5 app and don't care about IE? Great, use a lightweight hack-free plugin. Need to support IE? Use a hackish IE plugin.

In other words, you get to use the same top level API - sarge itself - and change the implementation of the DOM interaction via plugins.

Work in progress.
